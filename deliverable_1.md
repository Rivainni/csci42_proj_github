## Project Proposal

Our group shall create a web application that lets users track media such as movies, tv shows and books. 

- Users will search from a catalogue of media that are available via APIs across the internet. 
- Users will be able to save and keep track of the content that they would like to follow. 
- The system shall also store relevant information such as: 
    - rating, 
    - date watched
    - date released
    - whether they have the content in their library, 
    - whether they have watched and liked the content, 
    - other custom tags. 
    - history of what user has watched
- review and discuss the content with other users of the application.

The team shall coordinate and collaborate primarily via Gitlab's project management and version control tools. We also have committed to regular synchronous meetings via zoom.
